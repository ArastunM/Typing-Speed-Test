Perhaps
the
easiest
way
of
making
a
town's
acquaintance
is
to
ascertain
how
the
people
in
it
work,
how
they
love,
and
how
they
die.
In
our
little
town
(is
this,
one
wonders,
an
effect
of
the
climate?)
all
three
are
done
on
much
the
same
lines,
with
the
same
feverish
yet
casual
air.
The
truth
is
that
everyone
is
bored,
and
devotes
himself
to
cultivating
habits.
Our
citizens
work
hard,
but
solely
with
the
object
of
getting
rich.
Their
chief
interest
is
in
commerce,
and
their
chief
aim
in
life
is,
as
they
call
it,
"doing
business."
Naturally
they
don't
eschew
such
simpler
pleasures
as
love-making,
sea-
bathing,
going
to
the
pictures.
But,
very
sensibly,
they
re-
serve
these
pastimes
for
Saturday
afternoons
and
Sundays
and
employ
the
rest
of
the
week
in
making
money,
as
much
as
possible.
In
the
evening,
on
leaving
the
office,
they
for-
gather,
at
an
hour
that
never
varies,
in
the
cafes,
stroll
the
same
boulevard,
or
take
the
air
on
their
balconies.
The
passions
of
the
young
are
violent
and
short-Uved;
the
vices
of
older
men
seldom
range
beyond
an
addiction
to
bowling,
to
banquets
and
"socials,"
or
clubs
where
large
sums
change
hands
on
the
fall
of
a
card.
It
will
be
said,
no
doubt,
that
these
habits
are
not
peculiar
to
our
town;
really
all
our
contemporaries
are
much
the
same.
Certainly
nothing
is
commoner
nowadays
than
to
see
people
working
from
mom
tiU
night
and
then
proceeding
to
fritter
away
at
card-tables,
in
cafes
and
in
small-talk
what
time
is
left
for
living.
Nevertheless
there
still
exist
towns
and
coun-
tries
where
people
have
now
and
then
an
inkling
of
some-
thing
different.
In
general
it
doesn't
change
their
lives.
StiU,
they
have
had
an
intimation,
and
that's
so
much
to
the
good.
Oran,
however,
seems
to
be
a
town
without
intimations;
in
other
words,
completely
modem.
Hence
I
see
no
need
to
dwell
on
the
manner
of
loving
in
our
town.
The
men
and
women
consume
one
another
rapidly
in
what
is
called
"the
act
of
love,"
or
else
settle
dowTi
to
a
mild
habit
of
conju-
gality.
We
seldom
find
a
mean
between
these
extremes.
That,
too,
is
not
exceptional.
At
Oran,
as
elsewhere,
for
lack
of
time
and
thinking,
people
have
to
love
one
another
Avithout
knowing
much
about
it.
What
is
more
exceptional
in
our
town
is
the
difficulty
one
may
experience
there
in
dying.
"Difficulty,"
perhaps,
is
not
the
right
word;
"discomfort"
would
come
nearer.
Being
ill
is
never
agreeable,
but
there
are
towns
that
stand
by
you,
so
to
speak,
when
you
are
sick;
in
which
you
can,
after
a
fash-
ion,
let
yourself
go.
An
invalid
needs
small
attentions,
he
likes
to
have
something
to
rely
on,
and
that's
natural
enough.
But
at
Oran
the
violent
extremes
of
temperature,
the
exi-
gencies
of
business,
the
uninspiring
surroundings,
the
sudden
nightfalls,
and
the
very
nature
of
its
pleasures
call
for
good
health.
An
invalid
feels
out
of
it
there.
Think
what
it
must
be
for
a
dying
man,
trapped
behind
hundreds
of
walls
all
sizzling
with
heat,
while
the
whole
population,
sitting
in
cafes
or
hanging
on
the
telephone,
is
discussing
shipments,
bills
of
lading,
discounts!
It
will
then
be
obvious
what
dis-
comfort
attends
death,
even
modern
death,
when
it
waylays
you
under
such
conditions
in
a
dry
place.
These
somewhat
haphazard
observations
may
give
a
fair
idea
of
what
our
town
is
like.
However,
we
must
not
exag-
gerate.
Really,
all
that
was
to
be
conveyed
was
the
banality
of
the
town's
appearance
and
of
life
in
it.
But
you
can
get
through
the
days
there
without
trouble,
once
you
have
formed
habits.
And
since
habits
are
precisely
what
our
town
encourages,
all
is
for
the
best.
Viewed
from
this
angle,
its
life
is
not
particularly
exciting;
that
must
be
admitted.
But,
at
least,
social
unrest
is
quite
unknown
among
us.
And
our
frank-spoken,
amiable,
and
industrious
citizens
have
always
inspired
a
reasonable
esteem
in
visitors.
Treeless,
glamour-
less,
soulless,
the
town
of
Oran
ends
by
seeming
restful
and,
after
a
while,
you
go
complacently
to
sleep
there.
It
is
only
fair
to
add
that
Oran
is
grafted
on
to
a
unique
landscape,
in
the
center
of
a
bare
plateau,
ringed
with
lumi-
nous
hills
and
above
a
perfectly
shaped
bay.
All
we
may
regret
is
the
town's
being
so
disposed
that
it
turns
its
back
on
the
bay,
with
the
result
that
it's
impossible
to
see
the
sea,
you
always
have
to
go
to
look
for
it.
